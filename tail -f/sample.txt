If you are getting the desired output, then it means the program is running correctly. The C++ code provided reads the contents of the "input.txt" file and prints the last 10 lines to the console.

Make sure you have the "input.txt" file in the same directory as your C++ program, and it contains some text with at least 10 lines. If the file is not found or contains fewer than 10 lines, the program will print as many lines as are available.

If you encounter any issues, double-check the following:

Verify that you have saved the C++ code correctly and compiled it without any errors.

Ensure that the "input.txt" file exists in the same directory as the compiled executable.

Check the content of "input.txt" to ensure it has at least 10 lines of text.

If you still face issues or if the output is not as expected, please provide more details or error messages you are encountering, and I'd be glad to help you further.
